Track Explorer â€” Music Recommendation System (Ongoing)


Project Overview
Track Explorer is an ML-powered music recommendation system designed to suggest similar songs and genres based on audio features. This project uses a rich Spotify Tracks dataset containing over 114,000 songs across 125+ genres. It aims to combine cloud data processing, machine learning, and interactive UI design to build an engaging music discovery tool.


Current Progress

- Created a Spotify-themed PowerPoint presentation outlining the project concept and dataset overview.
- Detailed dataset exploration, highlighting key audio features and metadata from the Spotify Tracks Dataset sourced from Kaggle.
- Dataset includes 20+ audio features such as valence, energy, danceability, tempo, and genre labels.

Dataset
Public dataset available on Kaggle: Spotify Tracks Dataset

Data contains over 114,000 tracks, 125+ genres, and comprehensive audio feature columns.

Audio features sourced via Spotify Web API and compiled by the Kaggle contributor.

Next Steps
Data storage and engineering using Snowflake and Databricks

Machine learning model development on AWS SageMaker for genre prediction and similarity scoring

Development of an interactive UI (Streamlit) with planned integration of the Spotify API for real-time previews.
